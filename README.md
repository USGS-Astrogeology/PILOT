PILOT - Planetary Image Locator Tool

Source code for PILOT website (https://pilot.wr.usgs.gov). PILOT is an online data portal used by planetary scientists and
cartographers to search through the raw archives of the PDS Cartography and Imaging Science Node. PILOT relies on an image
metadata database with a schema similar to the Unified Planetary Coordinate (UPC) database maintained by the USGS Astrogeology
Science Center. The development of PILOT is supported by the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and the NASA/USGS PDS
Cartography and Imaging Science Node.
